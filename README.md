# WeatherApp

A small-scale Java Maven weather app created by a group of 3 students including me for a university course. The weather app gets its weather data from OpenWeather's Weather API and the GUI is created with the JavaFX framework. The whole project was completed in a short time period, as such it is not as refined as it could, best treated as a proof of concept.
